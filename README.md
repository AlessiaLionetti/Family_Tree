# Family_Tree

This project is a Python based family tree management system, originally designed as part of a computer science exam for my first year 
It allows users to model and explore relationships between individuals including parents, children, and spouses using object-oriented programming.

The system is interactive: users can select a person, view their relatives, and analyze information such as family connections, number of children, and more.
